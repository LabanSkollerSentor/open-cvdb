summary: |
  A researcher discovered a vulnerability enabling remote code execution within the Istio control plane. Exploiting this vulnerability necessitates elevated access
  privileges within the Kubernetes cluster where Istio operates. Under typical circumstances, this vulnerability would pose a low or informational risk. 
  Yet, within a managed Istio environment, the risk escalates. To illustrate, the researcher focused on Google-managed Anthos Service Mesh (ASM). 
  ASM operates the Istio control plane within a Google-managed project, utilizing a per-product per-project service account (P4SA) for authentication within the user's GKE cluster. 
  Ultimately, this vulnerability leads to remote code execution within the managed ASM control plane.
