summary: |
  An attacker could hijack a victim's account if there was a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in another subdomain of the application using Auth0, or on any *.auth0.com subdomain,
  and the victim could be lured to that site.
  Another possibility for exploitation was if the attacker could gain a Meddler-in-The-Middle (MiTM)
  position on a network to manipulate plaintext HTTP traffic for a victim.
  The domain auth0.com was not HSTS preloaded.
  A customer of Auth0 was required to enable a non-default feature called "Cross Origin Authentication"
  in order to be vulnerable to this session fixation.
  Auth0 confirmed the vulnerability on day #11 of the coordinated disclosure window and said on day #58
  (the 6th of September 2023), that they had mitigated the vulnerability.
