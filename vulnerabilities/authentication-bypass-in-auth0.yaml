summary: |
  In certain usage scenarios of Auth0, the vulnerability let an attacker impersonate any victim in an Auth0 customer’s system,
  simply by knowing the victim’s email address. It was possible to make Auth0 sign JWTs cross-tenant for users who did not exist.
  The vulnerability was found in their Preview environment which might be configured differently than their production environment.
  Auth0 have only acknowledged receipt of the vulnerability report and not confirmed any assumptions.
  They have since then changed the behavior of their system so that this vulnerability is no longer present.
