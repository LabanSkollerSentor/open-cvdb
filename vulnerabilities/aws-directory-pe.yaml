summary: |
  When configuring an AWS service to use an IAM role on ones behalf, it is necessary to have the iam:PassRole permission in addition to the permissions required 
  to configure and/or use the service.Due to a bug, AWS Directory Service didnâ€™t verify the presence of those permissions when assigning users or groups to 
  an existing IAM role. This allowed users with the ds:EnableRoleAccess permission to assign users to any role in their account that has a trust 
  relationship with AWS Directory service.
